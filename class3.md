## in this class I've read about how HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page, and how these new elements are playing an important part in creating layouts going forward.

## HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow us to divide up the  parts of a page.

## For Example :

* The header and footer elements

* The nav element

* The article element

* The section element

**The header and footer**
elements can be used for:

● The main header or footer 
that appears at the top or 
bottom of every page on the 
site.

● A header or footer for an 
individual article or 
section within the page

**The nav element is used to** : 

contain the major navigational 
blocks on the site such as the 
primary site navigation.

**The article element acts as**:

a container for any section of a 
page that could stand alone and 
potentially be syndicated.


## Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements

## The new elements provide clearer code ( compared  with using multiple < div > elements )
