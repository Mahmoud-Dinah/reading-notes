**Hello**

**HTML describes the structure of a web page**

**The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.**

**Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.**


**The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be written in lowercase.**

## Body, Head & Title

**body element  Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.**

**Head: Before the body element you will often see a head element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window**

**title: The contents of the title element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).**


**DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.**

**You can add comments to your code between the (<! -- and -->) markers.**

**The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.**

**The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.**

**< iframes > cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.**

**The < meta > tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.**

**Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©**

**It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.**

**Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.**

**Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.**

**Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.**

**You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.**

**You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.**

## How do computers fit in with the world around them ?

**Computers creat models of the world usuing data**

**the modles use objects to represent physical things**

**objects can have: properies that tell us about the object; method that perform tasks usuing the properties if that object; event which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.**

**programmers can write code to say ( when this event occurs, run that code)**


## How do i write a script for a web page?

**It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.**

**The HTML < script > element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).**

**If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.**
