### Box,

we can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes,

● Control the dimensions of boxes

● Create borders around boxes

● Set margins and padding for boxes

● Show and hide boxes

Box Dimensions

width

height

The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.

When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box.

When you use ems, the size of the box is based on the size of text within it. Designers have recently started to use percentages and ems more for measurements as they try to create designs that are flexible across devices which have different-sized screens.

Limiting Width, Limiting Height

min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height

These are very helpful properties to ensure that the content of pages are legible (especially on the smaller screens of handheld devices). For example, you can use the max-width property to ensure that lines of text do not appear too wide within a big browser window and you can use the min-width property to make sure that they do not appear too narrow.


Overflowing Content,

The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:

hidden

This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.

scroll

This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:Border, Margin & Padding

1-Border

Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

2-Margin

Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

3-Padding

Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values:

thin

medium

thick

The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border. 

The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.

### Lists,

there is three different types of list:

● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).

● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

Ordered Lists:

< ol >

The ordered list is created with the < ol > element.

< li >

Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li > tag and a closing < /li > tag. (The listands for list item.)


Unordered Lists:

< ul >

The unordered list is created with the < ul > element.

< li >

Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li > tag and a closing < /li > tag. (The listands for list item.)


Definition Lists:

< dl >

The definition list is created with the < dl > element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.

Inside the < dl > element  will usually see pairs of < dt > and < dd > elements.

< dt >

This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).

< dd >

This is used to contain the definition.

Nested Lists:

we can put a second list inside an < li > element to create a sublist or nested list.
