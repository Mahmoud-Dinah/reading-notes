## Forms

There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site.

ADDING TEXT:

Text input (single-line)Used for a single line of text such as email addresses and names

Password inputLike a single line text box but it masks the characters entered.

Text area (multi-line)For longer areas of text, such as messages and comments.


Making Choices:

Radio buttons

For use when a user must select one of a number of options.

Checkboxes

When a user can select and unselect one or more options

Drop-down boxes

When a user must pick one of a number of options from a list.

Submitting Forms:

Submit buttons

To submit data from your form to another web page.

Image buttons

Similar to submit buttons but they allow you to use an image


Uploading Files:

File upload

Allows users to upload files (e.g. images) to a website.

Form Structure:

< form >

Form controls live inside a < form> element. This element should always carry the actionattribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.

action:

Every < form> element requires an action attribute. Its valueis the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.

method

Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The getmethod is ideal for:

● short forms (such as search boxes)

● when you are just retrieving 

data from the web server (not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database)With the post method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the post method if your form:

● allows users to upload a file

● is very long

● contains sensitive data 
(e.g. passwords)

● adds information to, or deletes information from, a database

id:

the value is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page (and is often used by scripts — such as those that check you have entered information into fields that require values)

------------------

Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a < form> element.

 Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

 Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they selectare sent to the server.

HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.

Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. 

Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.

Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
