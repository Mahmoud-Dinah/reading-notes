## Adding image to your website

To add an image into the page you need to use an <img>element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

**src:**

This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images â€” relative URLs were covered on pages 83-84). 

**alt:**

This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

**title:**

You can also use the titleattribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

**Height & Width of Images**

height

This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

width

This specifies the width of the 
image in pixels.

`< img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450" />`

**Three Rules for Creating Images**

Save images in the right format

Save images at the right size

Use the correct resolution


The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.

**< figure>**

Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new < figure> element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. You can have more than one image inside the < figure>element as long as they all share the same caption.

**The < figcaption>**

element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.Before these elements were created there was no way to associate an < img> element with its caption.

## colors

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

rgb values

These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. 

For example: rgb(100,100,90)

hex codes

These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.
 
For example: #ee3e80

color names

There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.

For example: DarkCyan


**Background Color**

background-color



## Text

**Specifying Typefaces** : font-family :

The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use. 


**Size of Type:** font-size:

The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The

most common are:

pixels

Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px.

percentages

The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.
