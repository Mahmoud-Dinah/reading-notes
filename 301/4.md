## Forms:

### Controlled Components:

form elements such as < input >, < textarea >, and < select > typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a **“controlled component”**.

#### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?


**can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.**

#### Why would we use a ternary operator?

**it allows us to specify that a certain block of code should be executed if a certain condition is met.**

**x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)**
