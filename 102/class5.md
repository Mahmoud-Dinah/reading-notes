## learned today about:

## what comparison operators: evaluating conditions is, were we can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what we expect it might be. the result will be a boolean: true or false

**example:**

== is equal to

!= is not equal to

=== strict equal to

!=== strict not equal to

(>)greater than

< less than

<= greater than or equal to

(>=) less than or equal to


## Logical operators:

Comaparion operartors usually return single value of true or false, allow us to comapre the results of more than one compation operartor

&& Logical AND : this operartor test more than one condition

|| Logical OR: this opertator tests at leas one condition.

! Logical not: this operator take a single Boolean value and inverts it.

## LOOPS: check a condition. if it returns true, a code block will run.
then the conition will be checked again and if it still return true, the code block will run again.
it repeats unril the condition return false.

three common types of loops:

For: if you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop.
infor loop the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run

While: if we dont know how many times the code should run, we can use while loop.
here the condition can be something other than a counter and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.

DO WHILE: similar to while but it will always run the statment inside the curly braces at leats once, even if the condition evalutes to false
