## How to specify colors
## color termijnology and contrast
## background color

there are three common ways in  which we can indicate our choice of colors

The color property allows us
to specify the color of text inside 
an element. we can specify any 
color in CSS in one of three ways:

**RGB values**
These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90)

**hex codes**
These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80

**color names**
There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan

When picking foreground and background 
colors, it is important to ensure that there is 
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

1- Low Contrast
2- High Contrast
3- Medium Contrast



**Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue**

**Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGBvaluesspecifiednext to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.**
The hex value is provided 
next to the pound or hash 
(#)symbol. There is also a 
good color picking tool at:

opacity property which allows us to  specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
The value is a number between 
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% 
opacity).
