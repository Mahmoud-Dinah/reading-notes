## **Django Custom User Model**

## AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser

There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser. In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work.

## Custom User Model

Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

update config/settings.py

create a new CustomUser model

create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm

update the admin

### Now update accounts/models.py with a new User model which we'll call CustomUser.

```
 from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
 from django.db import models

 class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
    # add additional fields in here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username

```

We need new versions of two form methods that receive heavy use working with users. Stop the local server with Control+c and create a new file in the accounts app called forms.py.

(accounts) $ touch accounts/forms.py

```
     from django import forms
     from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm
     from .models import CustomUser

     class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):

        class Meta:
            model = CustomUser
            fields = ('username', 'email')

     class CustomUserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):

        class Meta:
            model = CustomUser
            fields = ('username', 'email')

```

Finally we update admin.py since the Admin is highly coupled to the default User model.

```
 from django.contrib import admin
 from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin


 from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm
 from .models import CustomUser

 class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    add_form = CustomUserCreationForm
    form = CustomUserChangeForm
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ['email', 'username',]

 admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)

```

And we're done! We can now run makemigrations and migrate for the first time to create a new database that uses the custom user model.

```
(accounts) $ python manage.py makemigrations accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py migrate

```

## Superuser


It's helpful to create a superuser that we can use to log in to the admin and test out log in/log out. On the command line type the following command and go through the prompts.

``` (accounts) $ python manage.py createsuperuser ```

Templates/Views/URLs
Our goal is a homepage with links to log in, log out, and sign up. Start by updating settings.py to use a project-level templates directory.

```# config/settings.py```


``` TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        'DIRS': [str(BASE_DIR.joinpath('templates'))], # new
        ...
    },
] 


```

Now that our custom user model is configured you can easily and at any time add additional fields to it. See the Django docs for further instructions.
