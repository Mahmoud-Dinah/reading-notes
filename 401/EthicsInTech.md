## Ethics in Technology
## Self Driving Car Ethics

 I'm agree with this article because as what mentioned in the article 
any computerized system that has an interface to the outside world is potentially hackable. Any computer scientist knows that it is very difficult to create software without any bugsâ€”especially when the software is very complex. Bugs may sometimes be security vulnerabilities

so might contain vulnerabilities that may be potentially exploited by hackers, or may rely on sensors for making decisions that may be tricked by hackers.

Im agree with Amazon workers in this article because 
the company's Rekognition technology would be used by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security in the current political climate.
