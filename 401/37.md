## Utility First CSS

 With Tailwind, you style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML.

```
<div class="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md flex items-center space-x-4">
  <div class="flex-shrink-0">
    <img class="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo">
  </div>
  <div>
    <div class="text-xl font-medium text-black">ChitChat</div>
    <p class="text-gray-500">You have a new message!</p>
  </div>
</div>

```

 ### **In the example above:**

Tailwind’s flexbox and padding utilities (flex, flex-shrink-0, and p-6) to control the overall card layout

The max-width and margin utilities (max-w-sm and mx-auto) to constrain the card width and center it horizontally

The background color, border radius, and box-shadow utilities (bg-white, rounded-xl, and shadow-md) to style the card’s appearance

The width and height utilities (w-12 and h-12) to size the logo image

The space-between utilities (space-x-4) to handle the spacing between the logo and the text

The font size, text color, and font-weight utilities (text-xl, text-black, font-medium, etc.) to style the card text

## benefits of usuing tailwindcss:

 - You aren’t wasting energy inventing class names.
 - Your CSS stops growing
 - Making changes feels safer.

## Next.js

 To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

 - Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
 - You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
 - You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use - - server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
 - You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
