## Classes and Objects:

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")


"self" as a parameter a little bit later. First, to assign the above class(template) to an object you would do the following:

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

Now the variable "myobjectx" holds an object of the class "MyClass" that contains the variable and the function defined within the class called "MyClass".

## Accessing Object Variables:

To access the variable inside of the newly created object "myobjectx" you would do the following:

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable

So for instance the below would output the string "blah":

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

print(myobjectx.variable)

You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class. For instance, if we were to define another object with the "MyClass" class and then change the string in the variable above:

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
myobjecty = MyClass()

myobjecty.variable = "yackity"

# Then print out both values
print(myobjectx.variable)
print(myobjecty.variable)

## Accessing Object Functions:

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()

## Thinking Recursively in Python:

### Recursive Functions in Python:

This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.


**a recursive function for calculating n! :**

**Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem. This is the recursive case:**

n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1
n! = n x (n−1)!

**As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they can be solved without further subdivision. This is the base case:**

n! = n x (n−1)! 
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2)!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3)!
⋅
⋅
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1!

-----------------

### Maintaining State

When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
Keep the state in global scope
A demonstration should make things clearer. Let’s calculate 1 + 2 + 3 ⋅⋅⋅⋅ + 10 using recursion. The state that we have to maintain is (current number we are adding, accumulated sum till now).


### Recursive Data Structures in Python

A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure. Let me demonstrate. Assume that you have only an empty list at your disposal, and the only operation you can perform on it is this:

 Return a new list that is the result of
 adding element to the head (i.e. front) of input_list

def attach_head(element, input_list):
    return [element] + input_list


Using the empty list and the attach_head operation, you can generate any list. For example, let’s generate [1, 46, -31, "hello"]:

attach_head(1,                                                  # Will return [1, 46, -31, "hello"]
            attach_head(46,                                     # Will return [46, -31, "hello"]
                        attach_head(-31,                        # Will return [-31, "hello"]
                                    attach_head("hello", [])))) # Will return ["hello"]

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage:

### Fixtures:

When you're writing tests, you're rarely going to write just one or two. Rather, you're going to write an entire "test suite", with each test aiming to check a different path through your code. In many cases, this means you'll have a few tests with similar characteristics, something that pytest handles with "parametrized tests".

But in other cases, things are a bit more complex. You'll want to have some objects available to all of your tests. Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests, or they might involve the network or filesystem. These are often known as "fixtures" in the testing world, and they take a variety of different forms.

In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition. For example, say you have a file that returns a list of lines from a file, in which each line is reversed:


def reverse_lines(f):
   return [one_line.rstrip()[::-1] + '\n'
           for one_line in f]

### Coverage

This is all great, but if you've ever done any testing, you know there's always the question of how thoroughly you have tested your code. After all, let's say you've written five functions, and that you've written tests for all of them. Can you be sure you've actually tested all of the possible paths through those functions?

For example, let's assume you have a very strange function, only_odd_mul, which multiplies only odd numbers:


def only_odd_mul(x, y):
   if x%2 and y%2:
       return x * y
   else:
       raise NoEvenNumbersHereException(f'{x} and/or {y}
 ↪not odd')

Here's a test you can run on it:


def test_odd_numbers():
   assert only_odd_mul(3, 5) == 15
